        <div class="story">
            <p>
                Tessa White and Nehaeh Hall met sophmore year in college in an microeconomics class. They discovered they were both majoring in environmental studies and quickly became friends. They got an apartment together senior year and not unlike others they found
                it to be a test of their friendship. Nevah was a minimalist while Tessa had hoarder like tendancies. It was after an argument about Tessa refusing to get rid of things that she's never used and acting like a hoarder that Tessa had an idea.
                Tessa had always wanted to open her own buisness and she figured if she opend a thrift store of sorts she would be able to "sell" her things that Nevah claimed she had no reason to keep. She could store her items in the back as "product"
                while she sold her actual products. When she pitched the idea to Nehaeh (leaving out the uninportant details) Nevaeh was on board with the idea of opening a sort of thrift store. She told Tessa she had actually be considering a similiar
                idea for some time as she hated the thought of people throwing out perfectly good items that could could at the very least be given away in favor of buying new stuff. While the girls had slightly differnt intentions behind opening the
                store they were excited about the idea and decided to open a store together after they graduated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tessa and Nevaeh opened RYUG in their hometown of Kent, Ohio in 2023 and have seen much success in the following years.
